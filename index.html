                My name's Robert Morrison and I'm a senior computer science and
                statistics student at the University of Maryland, College Park.
                I enjoy cooking, biking and working on projects like the ones
                below.

                        NetZero is a data collection tool I created for my 
                        neighbor to analyze the efficiency of his house. It
                        provides a simple command line interface, automatic data
                        storage and visualization, and easy extensibility to add
                        new data sources.
