                I am a senior computer science and statistics student at the University of Maryland, College Park.
                I enjoy learning about the systems around us and occasionally I enjoy experimenting with them
                myself. Most of my experience in the real world comes in the form of witnessing the flaws in our
                systems and being told to patch them. Through my work I have developed a reverence for the well
                designed systems around us. Outside of work I enjoy cooking, biking, and urban exploration.

                Throughout school, work and during my free time I have gained experience through different projects.
                In school I faithfully do my school work, and of course learn a lot. However like most people I learnt
                the most when I went off and did more practical things. I'm very greatful to have had the opportunity to
                participate in research alongside professors at my school. I learned most of what I know about software, data
                science and machine learning through the work I got to do there which I wouldn't have been able to get
                anywhere else. Also the various internships I have had taught me more about what I want to do...

                        NetZero is a data collection tool I created for my neighbor to analyze the efficiency of his house.
                        It provides a simple command line interface, automatic data storage and visualization, and easy
                        extensibility to add new data sources.

                        A poster I crafted as a result of the research I had done with a professor at my school. The work was 
                        mainly an applied machine learning effort focussing on the detection of vulnerabilities in large code bases
                        using static analysis techniques mixed with modern machine learning. I presented this work at RSA Conference
                        and my school's Undergraduate Research Day.
