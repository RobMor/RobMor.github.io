                    is a data collection tool I created for a friend to analyze
                    the efficiency of his house. It provides a simple command
                    line interface, automatic data storage and visualization,
                    and easy extensibility to add new data sources.

                    is a research tool developed as part of the semester
                    project for CMSC435. The goal of the project was to
                    streamline the collection of vulnerability data to aide
                    future research. In the end we succeeded in that goal and
                    produced a refined product with useful features for future
                    researchers.

                    is a simple tool I built for a friend in the same vein

                    project. It is meant to injest a camera feed of your homes
                    water meter to gauge approximately how much water you are
                    using.

                    solver built as a final project for CMSC388F: Functional
                    Pearls. I wrote it in Haskell and got the solve time down
                    to less than a second on large boards using techniques from
                    the class.

                    A Jupyter Notebook containing analysis done on the UN
                    General Assembly's debate transcripts. We attempted to
                    classify the home country of the speakers using simple
                    analysis of the words they used which proved surprisingly
                    effective.

                    A research project conducted with Dr.  Purtilo of the
                    University of Maryland to detect vulnerabilities in large
                    code bases using static analysis techniques mixed with
                    modern machine learning.  I presented this poster  at RSA

                    arduino to a nerf gun and used computer vision software to
                    lock the gun when it would make a lethal shot.
